# Algorithm Analysis: Mini Project 1
This project involves solving a real-world problem using programming tools and paradigms, with a focus on algorithm design. The problem is related to data collection of pollution levels in a city using smartphones as sensors. The project aims to optimize the budget for data acquisition while maximizing the coverage of sensors across the city.
## Team Members
- Ryan McDonald
- Noah Legault
- Andrew Donate

## Features
- A program will be implemented in C++, MATLAB, or Python.
- The program will visualize the coverage resulting from the smart data acquisition mechanism.
- An experiment will be conducted to show that the approach outperforms naive data acquisition policies in terms of area or sensor coverage while optimizing the budget.
- A presentation will be delivered to showcase the approach.

## Project Structure
The project will follow the following structure:

1. Introduction: Provides an overview of the project and its goals.
2. Rubric: Describes the evaluation criteria for the project, including program running, algorithm design, experiment design, report, and presentation.
3. Learning Outcomes: Lists the learning objectives that will be achieved upon completing the project.
4. Problem Description: Explains the background and context of the problem, which involves data collection of pollution levels in a city using smartphones as sensors.
5. Sensor Model: Describes the assumptions and model for the sensors, including their coverage area.
6. Data Acquisition Model: Explains the assumptions and requirements for acquiring a representative set of samples within the given budget.

## Rubric for Evaluation
