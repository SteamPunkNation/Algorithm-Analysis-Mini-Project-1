# Algorithm-Analysis-Mini-Project-1
This mini-project explores the solution to a real problem using the programming tools and paradigms we
have learned so far.
# Learning Outcomes
* Apply algorithm design to tackle a real problem.
* Implement a solution and choose the programming language that better fits the problem requirements.
* Apply a greedy or Dynamic programming approach to solve a problem.
* Experiment with design to demonstrate that your solution outperforms a given approach

# Problem Description
Orlando is becoming a smart city, namely, a city whose services and data support decisions. 
Thus, the town is interested in acquiring sensor readings of pollution at high granularity.
One of its main goals is to get a more accurate sense of the pollution levels in the city. 
Thus, the town subcontracts a data collection campaign to a new startup company in Lakeland. 
The company's name is (Algorithm and design class). 
They specialize in profitable high-tech projects with a focus on algorithm design.
